# Next Session

Updated: 2026-06-18T21:48:45+03:00

Resume the active execution run. Do not restart, re-plan, run a baseline UI crawl, run watch loops, or deploy.

Current branch: `codex/2026-06-18-bna-platform-completion`.

Latest completed local batches:

- REQ-20260618-126 through REQ-20260618-135 have local Operations shell/workspace/navigation/layout/header/design/mobile-control/desktop-grid/accessibility implementations and focused tests.
- REQ-20260618-132: semantic Operations design tokens and shared high-contrast surface/button/type/focus primitives are implemented.
- REQ-20260618-133: touch-safe mobile target sizing, scrollable dense controls, and reachable modal action footers are implemented.
- REQ-20260618-134: desktop dashboard, task, pipeline, content, and student grids use balanced auto-fit/readable minmax tracks.
- REQ-20260618-135: task modal semantics/focus, explicit labels, keyboard-activatable cards, pressed/current filter state, and disabled/sr-only primitives are implemented.
- REQ-20260618-136: canonical task states are implemented across schema/migration, API create/filter/update paths, queue filters, and Operations UI with legacy alias compatibility.
- REQ-20260618-137: task cards and modal now separate owner/status/urgency/due/blocker/provenance from visible titles, with blocker_reason stored in the task schema/API.
- REQ-20260618-138: high-confidence task intake auto-files, low-confidence task-like intake becomes a Decision with routing choices, and no separate visible Review Queue lane was introduced.
- REQ-20260618-139: internal scoped Calendar aggregates task due/planned dates, class sessions, accountability check-ins/events, and group goal due dates without external sync controls.
- REQ-20260618-140: stale worker/agent diagnostics, heartbeat/status panels, Changelog Queue wording, proof-gap concepts, and client-side agent-fleet status fetches are removed from the main task UI while Changelog remains as an activity lane.

Exact next requirement:

- REQ-20260618-141 / BNA-TASKS-006: Live scoped counts and blocker explanations.

Exact next command:

```powershell
npm run bna:run:status
rg -n "decisionCount|myTaskCount|changelogCount|urgentCount|hiddenCaptures|blocker|blocked|blocker_reason|taskViewState|operationsCommandMetrics|renderTaskOverview|renderTaskOverviewStrip|page-status-pill|task-row-meta" public\operations.html server.js tests
```

Then inspect live task counts and blocked-task rendering so counts derive from the currently scoped data and blocked/stale states link to visible task records with explanations.

Still open after this batch:

- REQ-20260618-124 remains `in_progress` until broader workspace-owned entity API filtering, release approval, deploy, and live smoke are complete.
- REQ-20260618-125 through REQ-20260618-140 remain `needs_verification` until final acceptance sweep, release approval, deploy, and live smoke where applicable.
- Audit-output-only items remain blocked only where screenshot/audit output is genuinely required.

No deployment or production-data mutation is approved.
