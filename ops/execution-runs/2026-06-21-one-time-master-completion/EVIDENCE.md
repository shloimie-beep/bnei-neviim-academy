## Batch 4 Evidence

Workspace user and role implementation is deployed and live-verified.

- Canonical role model:
  `src/lib/bna/one-time-role-model.js`
- Platform RBAC normalization and permissions:
  `src/platform/rbac/index.js`
- Server-side workspace membership, role audit, and scoped user APIs:
  `server.js`
- Operations scoped Users screen and real membership actions:
  `public/operations.html`
- Focused role/auth/UI tests:
  `tests/workspace-user-role-management.test.js`,
  `tests/one-time-role-auth-model.test.js`, and
  `tests/external-access-persistence-workflow.test.js`

Implemented behavior:

- Rabbi Ellie Scheller is the public-facing One Time owner/admin identity while
  legacy Rabbi name aliases remain accepted.
- Shloimie retains platform super-admin status and One Time workspace
  admin/manager access for intentional workspace switching.
- Canonical platform, workspace, and member roles are normalized and validated.
- The scoped Operations Users screen supports no-send Add Member / Invite User,
  Assign Role, Deactivate, Reactivate, reversible Remove Membership, and
  role-change audit readback.
- Server APIs enforce workspace scope and deny scoped managers platform-role
  assignment and cross-workspace membership mutation.
- Production external writes, sends, billing changes, and hard deletes: 0.

Deployment and live evidence:

- Implementation commit: `c8d93646`
- Pushed commit: `c8d93646`
- Deployed commit: `c8d93646`
- Railway deployment: `04fde749-fca1-4e54-a7c4-f2ece847847b`
- Standard live smoke:
  `ops/live-smokes/2026-06-21T09-51-25-585Z-live-app-smoke.md`
- Focused workspace-user live smoke:
  `ops/live-smokes/2026-06-21T09-53-03-531Z-workspace-user-role-live-smoke.md`

Focused live smoke confirmed:

- `/api/bna/workspace-users?workspace_key=rabbi_sheller_provider` is readable.
- `/api/bna/workspace-users/role-audit?workspace_key=rabbi_sheller_provider`
  is readable.
- One Time users are scoped to `rabbi_sheller_provider`.
- Canonical roles are visible in live readback.
- `bna_main` does not leak into the One Time workspace-user readback.
- Operations Users HTML contains Add Member and role-audit controls.
- The old Provider Users dead placeholder is absent.
